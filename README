I first completed the 6.S081 lab in the summer of 2024, 
when my programming skills were quite low, and the code I produced was almost a complete mess. 
I encountered numerous errors, especially when dealing with complex mechanisms like locks, multithreading, and page faults. 
Then, in the autumn of 2024, I took on the 6.S081 lab again, and this time I felt that the code I wrote was elegant and robust.
